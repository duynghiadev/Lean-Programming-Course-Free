# 12. Bài toán gọi taxi

Of course! It sounds like you want to work on a JavaScript exercise related to calling a taxi. Let's break it down.

Here's a simple scenario: You have a function that calculates the fare for a taxi ride based on the distance traveled. We'll use a basic formula for this exercise, but in real-world applications, it would be more complex, considering factors like time of day, traffic, etc.

Let's start by defining the function:

```js
function calculateTaxiFare(distance) {
  // Assume a base fare and a rate per kilometer
  const baseFare = 2; // Base fare in dollars
  const ratePerKilometer = 1.5; // Rate per kilometer in dollars

  // Calculate the total fare
  const totalFare = baseFare + ratePerKilometer * distance;

  return totalFare;
}
```

This function takes the distance traveled (in kilometers) as input and returns the total fare (in dollars).

Now, let's use this function to solve the problem:

```js
// Call the function with a sample distance
const distanceTraveled = 10; // 10 kilometers
const fare = calculateTaxiFare(distanceTraveled);

// Output the result
console.log('The fare for the taxi ride is $' + fare.toFixed(2));
```

In this example, we're assuming the distance traveled is 10 kilometers. You can change the `distanceTraveled` variable to any value you want to test.

This exercise helps you practice working with functions and mathematical operations in JavaScript, specifically related to calculating taxi fares based on distance. Feel free to modify and expand upon it as needed!
