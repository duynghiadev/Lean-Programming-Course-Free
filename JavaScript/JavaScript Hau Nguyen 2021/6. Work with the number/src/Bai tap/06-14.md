# 14. So sánh 2 số nguyên

Certainly! Let's create a function to compare two integer numbers in JavaScript:

```js
function compareNumbers(num1, num2) {
  if (num1 === num2) {
    return `${num1} is equal to ${num2}`;
  } else if (num1 > num2) {
    return `${num1} is greater than ${num2}`;
  } else {
    return `${num1} is less than ${num2}`;
  }
}

// Example usage
const number1 = 10;
const number2 = 5;
console.log(compareNumbers(number1, number2));
```

In this function `compareNumbers`, we take two integer numbers as input and compare them using conditional statements. If the numbers are equal, we return a string indicating that. If `num1` is greater than `num2`, we return a string indicating that. Otherwise, we return a string indicating that `num1` is less than `num2`.

You can test this function with different pairs of integer numbers to see how it compares them. This exercise helps you practice working with conditional statements and function parameters in JavaScript.
