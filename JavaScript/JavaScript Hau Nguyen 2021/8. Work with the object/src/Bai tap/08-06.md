# 6. Viết hàm clone object nhưng không dùng spread operator

Sure, I can help you write a function in JavaScript to clone an object without using the spread operator. Here's how you can do it:

```js
function cloneObject(obj) {
  // Check if obj is actually an object
  if (typeof obj !== 'object' || obj === null) {
    return obj;
  }

  // Create a new object to store the cloned properties
  let clonedObj = {};

  // Iterate over the properties of the original object
  for (let key in obj) {
    // Check if the property belongs to the object itself and not inherited
    if (obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
      // Clone each property recursively if it's an object, otherwise, copy its value
      clonedObj[key] =
        typeof obj[key] === 'object' && obj[key] !== null ? cloneObject(obj[key]) : obj[key];
    }
  }

  return clonedObj;
}

// Example usage:
const originalObj = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  address: {
    city: 'New York',
    country: 'USA',
  },
};

const clonedObj = cloneObject(originalObj);
console.log(clonedObj);
```

This function `cloneObject` recursively clones all properties of the input object `obj` into a new object `clonedObj`. It checks if each property is an object itself and recursively clones it if necessary. This way, you get a deep copy of the object without using the spread operator.

# Explanation of JavaScript Code for Cloning Object

This Markdown file explains the JavaScript code provided for cloning an object without using the spread operator.

## Code Breakdown

1. The function `cloneObject` takes one parameter, `obj`, which is the object you want to clone.

2. Inside the function, it first checks if the `obj` parameter is actually an object and not `null` or another data type like a string or number. This is done using the `typeof` operator and checking if it's equal to `'object'`. If it's not an object, the function simply returns the input object itself because there's no need to clone it.

3. Next, a new empty object called `clonedObj` is created. This object will store the cloned properties.

4. The function then iterates over all the properties of the original object `obj` using a `for...in` loop.

5. Within the loop, it checks if each property belongs to the object itself (and not inherited from its prototype) using the `hasOwnProperty` method. This ensures that only the object's own properties are cloned, not properties inherited from its prototype chain.

6. For each property, it checks if its value is an object itself and not `null`. If it is, the function recursively calls itself (`cloneObj`) to clone that nested object. This recursion ensures that nested objects are cloned deeply.

7. If the property's value is not an object, it simply copies its value to the cloned object.

8. Finally, the function returns the `clonedObj`, which now contains all the properties of the original object, including nested objects, but is a completely separate object in memory.

**_Example Usage_**

The example usage at the bottom demonstrates how to use the `cloneObj` function by cloning an example object and logging the cloned object to the console.
