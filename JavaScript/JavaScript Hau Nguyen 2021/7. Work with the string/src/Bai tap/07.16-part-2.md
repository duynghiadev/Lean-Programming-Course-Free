Of course, let's simplify the approach using basic string methods in JavaScript. We'll use the `indexOf` method to find the position of the secret code within the text:

```js
function findSecretCode(text, secretCode) {
  const foundOccurrences = [];
  let index = text.indexOf(secretCode);

  // Loop through the text and find all occurrences of the secret code
  while (index !== -1) {
    foundOccurrences.push(index);
    index = text.indexOf(secretCode, index + 1);
  }

  return foundOccurrences;
}

// Example usage:
const text = 'The secret code is ABC123. The ABC123 code is hidden.';
const secretCode = 'ABC123';

const foundOccurrences = findSecretCode(text, secretCode);
console.log(foundOccurrences); // Output: [16, 41]
```

In this function:

- We initialize an empty array `foundOccurrences` to store the positions of the secret code.

- We use the `indexOf` method to find the first occurrence of the secret code in the text. If found, we push its position to the `foundOccurrences` array.

- We continue to search for the secret code in the text by setting the `index` to the position after the last found occurrence (`index + 1`). We repeat this process until no more occurrences are found (`indexOf` returns `-1`).

- Finally, we return the array containing the positions of all occurrences of the secret code in the text.

❓ - If the value of 'index' equals -1, then the loop will exit, right?

✅ - Yes, exactly! In JavaScript, the `indexOf` method returns `-1` when the substring (in this case, the secret code) is not found in the string. So, when `index` becomes `-1`, the loop condition `index !== -1` evaluates to `false`, and the loop exits. This prevents the loop from continuing indefinitely when no more occurrences of the secret code are found in the text.
