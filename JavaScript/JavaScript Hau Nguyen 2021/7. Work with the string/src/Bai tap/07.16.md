To search for a secret code within a string, we can use more advanced methods of string manipulation in JavaScript. Here's an example using regular expressions and the `match` method to find all occurrences of the secret code within a given string:

```js
function findSecretCode(text, secretCode) {
  // Create a regular expression pattern using the secret code
  const pattern = new RegExp(secretCode, 'gi');

  // Use the match method to find all occurrences of the secret code
  const matches = text.match(pattern);

  // Return the array of matches
  return matches || []; // Return an empty array if no matches found
}

// Example usage:
const text = 'The secret code is ABC123. The ABC123 code is hidden.';
const secretCode = 'ABC123';

const foundOccurrences = findSecretCode(text, secretCode);
console.log(foundOccurrences); // Output: ['ABC123', 'ABC123']
```

In this function:

- We create a regular expression pattern using the `RegExp` constructor, where `secretCode` is the pattern we want to search for. The `'gi'` flags are used for a global search (find all matches) and case-insensitive search.

- We then use the `match` method of the `text` string to find all occurrences of the secret code that match the pattern.

- Finally, we return the array of matches. If no matches are found, we return an empty array.
